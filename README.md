# Attendance-Calculator-using-MIT-App-Inventor
Give total classes and attended classes, it will show the attendance percentage, how many classes you need to attend if the % is less and other few infos.

It was my first project in MIT App Inventor. If any suggestions please inform me via kpkarthik333@gmail.com.
